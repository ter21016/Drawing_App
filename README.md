# Overview

This is a simple drawing app built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. I created it to get hands-on experience with TypeScript while learning how to work with event-driven programming, DOM manipulation, and the Canvas API.

With this app, you can draw freehand, create shapes (lines, rectangles, and circles), and even add text to your drawing. It also lets you choose colors, adjust brush size, and clear the canvas whenever you need a fresh start.

Building this project helped me practice using TypeScript modules, improve my ability to handle user interactions, and sharpen my front-end development skills. Plus, it was a lot of fun to make!

# Future Work
There are a few things I’d love to improve and add in future updates:

* Undo/Redo Functionality – Allow users to revert mistakes
* Download as JPEG/PDF – Export drawings in different formats
* Mobile Touch Support – Enable drawing on tablets and mobile devices
* Layers Feature – Organize elements in different layers like Photoshop

This project has been a fun challenge, and I learned a lot about TypeScript, event handling, and working with the Canvas API.
